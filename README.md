# Restaurant Review App

## Background

The Restaurant review app was done as a part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree course.


## Instructions

Download the `.zip` file to your computer or clone it:

```git clone https://github.com/TanelS/Restaurant-Reviews-App```

If you have Python installed run a simple local webserver:

- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

- When server is running visit the URL `http://localhost:8000`

It should be noted that Python webserver can behave badly at times, SHIFT-_reload_ helps in most cases. 

App is optimized for the desktop, Google Nexus 5 and Apple iPad.
